11/1/2014 - The creation of the GUI was designed with three text boxes on top. The text boxes on top make it easier for the User to see what is happening.
- new button added to GUI design.
11/2/2014 - I made the set contens work in the GUI
11/3/2014 - Creation of a save file menu was made. save menu added. Open menu added.
Open dialog takes the file and makes a new spreadsheet out of it. The model of data is then referenced to the new spreadsheet
11/4/2014 - Fixed Formula bug, Fixed open dialogue bug
11/5/2014 - Played into changing various small techniques and added the bunches of small tools to build into the major 
strengths of the program and it works very well sweet okay
- I also Fixed the circular exception where it gets reverted back if a circular exception gets asserted
- Once a cell changes that has dependents the cells will be recalcualted
-
