Brought to you by Aaron Hsu the date is currently 9/26/2014  -- u0784935!!

This project was taken from a bunch of skeletons and added on to make a working thing...
YEA!!
Sup bro you have stumbled upon greatness with this very class. Hehehe, Well you see after hours and hours of work you are in the witness
of a class that can do calculations while having cells dependent with each other!

============================================================
ABOUT THE CREATOR:
This was so annoying to program. I sort of want to punch myself right now it is so late hahaha.
wow spent hours coding this hahahaahha...
=============================================================================================================================================
This GUI IS VERY HARD TO USE. It is also a little inefficient!! BUT! IT took a long time to make so it must be worth something...


=============================================================================================================================================
=============================================================================================================================================
Functionality!!!! You can use arrow to move around on the cell. There are save, save as and open functions. One can close the tab and
it will warn you if you have not saved yet! Also you can undo typing in boxes.. There is also the support of some fonts in the spreadsheet!
One can also use the = sign to add equations. Dependencies will change according to cells!!

11/1/2014 - The creation of the GUI was designed with three text boxes on top. The text boxes on top make it easier for the User to see what is happening.
- new button added to GUI design.
11/2/2014 - I made the set contens work in the GUI
11/3/2014 - Creation of a save file menu was made. save menu added. Open menu added.
Open dialog takes the file and makes a new spreadsheet out of it. The model of data is then referenced to the new spreadsheet
11/4/2014 - Fixed Formula bug, Fixed open dialogue bug
11/5/2014 - Played into changing various small techniques and added the bunches of small tools to build into the major 
strengths of the program and it works very well sweet okay
- I also Fixed the circular exception where it gets reverted back if a circular exception gets asserted
- Once a cell changes that has dependents the cells will be recalcualted
- Change the fonts of the spreadsheet has been added does not support a lot of fonts
- The ability to revert back to your previous cell if a formula entered is wonky
- The ability to Undo has been added!!
